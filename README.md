# ReactCSS_TaskManagerApp
This is a React project aligned with CSS, Created to manage task for scrum developer as like JIRA/Servicenow,
I developed a simple and interactive Task Manager App built with React and Vite. 
This application allows users to organize tasks by categories (Development, Testing, Deployment), mark tasks as completed, and shift tasks between categories with remarks.
Features of this App:
Add Tasks: Create tasks and assign them to specific categories.
Shift Tasks: Move tasks between categories (Development, Testing, Deployment) with remarks.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from any category.
Dynamic Styling: Responsive design with CSS.
Real-Time Updates: Tasks update immediately without page refresh.

Future Enhancements :
Task Deadlines: Add due dates for tasks.
Drag and Drop: Enable drag-and-drop functionality for smoother task management.
Persistence: Save tasks using local storage or a database.
Authentication: Secure tasks with user accounts.
